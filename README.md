# Gymnasium Cartpole

This repository contains an implementation to solve the [CartPole-v1](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/) problem from the OpenAI Gym or Gymnasium . The goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart by applying discrete forces.

## Introduction

The CartPole problem is a classic reinforcement learning challenge where an agent learns to balance a pole on a moving cart. The goal is to apply forces to keep the pole upright as long as possible. In this project, we solve the problem using [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning), a fundamental algorithm in reinforcement learning.
